This is a project for REST skeleton using CRUD operations.

There are no front-end interactions as this is only to serve for creating a test environment for creating models and routes for future use.
To use this skeleton it is important to have set up a MongoDB cluster and created a user that you are able to connect to.

// BEFORE

Set-up MongoDB and create a collection.
Save the user info in your .env file and use the URI to connect to MongoDB.

// INITIALIZE

I am using the REST extension to test the routes in VSC. Here you can see how this is set-up in the route.rest file. 
In this we are using the four CRUD operations (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) to test our REST application. 

// RUN THE PROJECT

To run the project -> use npm run dev
